This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to show case authentication using [Auth0](https://auth0.org/).

## Getting Started

First, copy the `.env.dist` file and rename it to `.env.local`. Copy your own project credentials on each line.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
